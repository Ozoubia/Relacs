## Introduction
Relacs is a Desktop application (for windows) built in C#, it provides soothing sounds and music to boost productivity or relax when 
working, studing or just relaxing, it offers the possiblity to mix sounds together (ex: waterfall sound, with birds and firecracking sound)
there are 19 sounds for now to choose from and play with, from instruments to nature sounds

## Prerequisites
* [Material Design in XAML Plugin](http://materialdesigninxaml.net/)


## Setup
1- First you start by cloning the project in your hard drive <br />
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/Ozoubia/Relacs.git
    ```
   
2- Open the project in Visual studio IDE <br />
3- You will have to install the missing packages, Go to NuGet Package Manager in VS, It'll ask you to download the missing packages 
automatically which is the best option, wait for them to be installed and you're good to go.<br />
4- If the automatic package download fails you have to download each package manually, here are the packages:
   * MaterialDesignThemes

**PS** : Sometimes installing the packages automatically will install **EntityFramework.SQlServerCompact** along with them 
(which in this case we don't need and it will cause an error, 
so if it is installed go to NuGet Package Manager and remove it from the project)
